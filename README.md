# ml_6350
This is a machine learning project developed by Daniel Waldram for CS 5350/6350 in University of Utah.
This projects goal is to make predictions as to whether income level is above 50k given 14 features as input. The main file that trains a neural net to make predictions is tensor_flow_final_vals.py. This file outputs predictions for the testing data in the test_final.csv file that is in the data folder.

Use ./run.sh to run tensor_flow_final_vals.py 
Use ./run_supporting.sh to run the statistical_analysis.py and depth_width_testing.py files which were used to determine optimal parameters for the neural net.
